# Emacs for Symfony2


Working with the Symfony2 framework is great. Unless you loose to much time to find your PHP files and change folder by clicking on this very little "+" that allows you to see the folder tree... Choose the best editor. Choose Emacs.

Here is my Emacs configuration to use with all kind of PHP project and specially with Symfony2 based project.
